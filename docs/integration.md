# Consumer integration

Applications supply their own vocabulary snapshots, declarations and representative output. Use `TermDeclaration`, `ModelDeclaration`, `FieldDeclaration` and `ValueDeclaration` directly, or extract them through the optional Pydantic/LinkML adapters. The library does not discover application source or infer biological meaning. Runnable examples include ordinary dataclasses and independent catalogue workflows.

Select local, import and lookup scopes deliberately. Use coverage for owned namespaces and membership checks for external terms; lookup documents must not conceal missing local declarations. A required constructor field does not prove RDF emission: declare that guarantee explicitly and check representative serialised output with `check_emission`.

For JSON-LD, pass original usages and expectations to `check_context`. Reuse explicit resources and logical bases across parsing, serialisation and `prepare_jsonld` conversion. Default loaders do not fetch missing resources. Consumer-owned loaders or validation services have their own network behaviour; configuring this library does not make an entire application offline.

Keep findings and unsupported comparisons visible. Apply narrow code/location exceptions through `AcceptancePolicy`; they do not change verification truth. Retain application validation, reference checks and any existing reasoning gate. Supplied-shapes validation is an optional additional operation, not general OWL consistency checking.

Evaluate a fixed wheel in a dependency-consistent environment on the consumer’s supported interpreter. Check installed import origin, run real integration cases and include a deliberate missing-term or incorrect-mapping case. The consumer remains responsible for required input fields, domain decisions and dependency migration.
